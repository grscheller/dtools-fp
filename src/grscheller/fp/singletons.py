"""### Module fp.singletons - collection of singleton classes

Classes permitting at most only one instantiation. Safer, but not as performant,
than a non-exported module level global. Difficult, but not impossible, for
a typical end-user to exploit. Different versions tailored for different use
cases.

#### Singleton types:

* **class NoValue:** singleton instance "containing" no value
* **Class Sentinel:** singleton instances used as a "hidden" sentinel value
* **class Nada:** singleton instance representing & propagating failure

##### NoValue was designed as a None replacement

While `None` represents "returned no values," `NoValue()` represents the absence
of a value. End-users use both `None` and `()` as sentinel values which can
collide with using either to represent "nothingness." Non-existing values should
not be comparable to anything, even themselves.

---

##### Here is another implementation for Sentinel:

* on GitHub: [taleinat/python-stdlib-sentinels](https://github.com/taleinat/python-stdlib-sentinels)
* on PyPI: [Project: Sentinels](https://pypi.org/project/sentinels/)
* see: [PEP 661](https://peps.python.org/pep-0661/)

This one is quite close to mine, but enables different sentinels with different
names, and can be pickled. These last two extra features make this
implementation overly complicated. Also, I think it is a bad idea to send
information or implementation down-the-wire in the form of either stringified
source code or binary executables. Use a communication protocol for the
former and a package manager for the later.

---

##### Nada propagates failure

Nada is a singleton representing & propagating failure. Failure just blissfully
propagates down "the happy path." For almost everything you do with it, it just
returns itself. The maintainer has not used this construct enough yet to
determine if it is a brilliant idea or a horrible blunder.
