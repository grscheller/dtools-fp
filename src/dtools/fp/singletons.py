"""### Module dtools.fp.singletons - collection of singleton classes

Classes permitting at most only one instantiation. Safer, but not as performant,
than a non-exported module level global. Difficult, but not impossible, for
a typical end-user to exploit. Different versions tailored for different use
cases. Used mostly for dtools internal implementations.

#### Singleton types:

* **class NoValue:** singleton instance representing the absence of a value
* **Class Sentinel:** singleton instances used as a "hidden" sentinel value
* **class Nada:** singleton instance representing & propagating failure

##### `NoValue` was designed as a None replacement

While `None` represents "returned no values," `NoValue()` represents the absence
of a value. Non-existing values should not be comparable to anything, even
themselves. End-users may use both `None` and `()` as sentinel values which
colliding with using either to represent "nothingness." 

---

##### `Sentinel` values used as hidden implementation details

* Here is another implementation for Sentinel:``
  * on GitHub: [taleinat/python-stdlib-sentinels](https://github.com/taleinat/python-stdlib-sentinels)
  * on PyPI: [Project: Sentinels](https://pypi.org/project/sentinels/)
  * see: [PEP 661](https://peps.python.org/pep-0661/)

Initially this one was somewhat close to mine and also enabled pickling.
Subsequently it was "enhanced" to allow sentinel values to be subclassed. My
implementation is substantially more simple, python implementation independent,
less Gang-of-Four OOP, and more Pythonic.

---

##### `Nada` propagates failure

Nada is a singleton representing & propagating failure. Failure just blissfully
propagates down "the happy path." For almost everything you do with it, it just
returns itself. The maintainer has not used this construct enough yet to
determine if it is a brilliant idea or a horrible blunder.
